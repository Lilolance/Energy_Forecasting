# Energy Forecasting — Project Overview

This repository contains two implementations of a quarter-hourly Belgium energy-forecasting prototype:

- energy-forecasting-initial/: initial implementation — raw data, exploratory notebook(s) and a simple Python script for preprocessing and modelling.  
- energy-forecasting-streamlit/: Streamlit application wrapping the pipeline; includes a Dockerfile for containerization and artifacts used for deployment to Azure.
