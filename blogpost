For a possible blog post!
Let me provide the context for this project:

Having completed the course "Machine Learning Specialization" by deeplearning.ai, I am at the exciting point where I can put the theory into practice by applying it in a project with real-world data.

As someone interested in sustainability and thinking about how to reduce our impact as a society, energy production and consumption has been a hot topic both scientifically as politically. A recurring theme is the impact of wind and solar energy on the stability of the electricity grid (https://www.creg.be/sites/default/files/assets/Publications/Studies/F2866NL.pdf) and the compatibility of renewable energy sources (e.g. wind and solar) and nuclear energy. In order to, on the one hand, plan out a policy and, on the other hand, keep a stable day-to-day grid, it is necessary to have a correct prediction of our energy consumption (in this case Belgium). It thus looks like an excellent opportunity to see how the approaches I have learned, could aid in improving these predictions. The exciting part is also that this is an active field of study (by grid operators such as Elia for example) with an immediate real-world impact. Let us take a shot at it. 

In this project, we will predict quarterhourly energy consumption (the total load) in Belgium by training it on historical data by ENTSO-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity). The historical data can be retrieved from their transparency platform (https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show). Interestingly, they also provide their own predictions which can serve as a benchmark for our models.

In the notebook, we experiment with and finetune three different models on a restricted data set (from 01.01.2025 till 20.10.2025, i.e. ~28K data points):
- linear regression model with feature engineering (periodic, combined, normalization)
- random forest using XGBoost
- small neural network

Let me describe the problem scope and our findings.

Predicting quarterhourly energy consumption is a timeseries prediction problem with features:
- target value: energy consumption in Belgium on a 15 minute interval [continuous]
- input features:
    - date & time: split up into 
        - month [periodic]
        - day of month [periodic]
        - day of week [periodic]
        - hour [periodic]
        - quarter [periodic]
        - time_index [continuous] : added to capture
